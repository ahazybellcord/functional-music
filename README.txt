To run this project, you must first install the Jython Environment for Music (JEM), 
freely available for Windows, Mac, and Linux at https://jythonmusic.me/download/.

Once installed, launch the JEM and load the "project.py" file from the project
directory.

Click the the play button at the top left of the JEM window to run the program.

You can watch the current progress of part and phrase generation in the console window.

Once the composition has been generated, it will play back automatically.

A window will appear, allowing you to enter a name to save the MIDI file under. 
[Note: Hitting the Cancel button ends MIDI playback.]

An example of a composition generated by this program is provided in the project directory: 'example.mid' is a MIDI file created from a run of the program and 'example.flac' is the corresponding captured audio of the MIDI playback at runtime.


[Important: If any of the files: 'primes.txt', 'factorizations.txt', or 'divisors.txt' 
is not found within the project directory, run the 'buildLookupTables.py' script to 
create them anew. These look-up tables significantly lower the running time for score creation. The script may take quite some time to complete.]
